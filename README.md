WeathApp

CreativeDays WeathApp Demo - http://www.adobecreativedays.com/es

This is a sample weather application build with AngularJS, TweenLite.js, jQuery, Leaflet, Forecast.io API and Google Maps API.

This application was conceived to run in the browser but you could make it work with PhoneGap. If you want to test the app with PhoneGap you will need to remove comments on script phonegap.js and the pgApp.initialize().

You will also need to put your API keys for Forecast.io and Google Maps.
